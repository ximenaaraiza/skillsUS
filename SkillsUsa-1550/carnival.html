    <h3 class="History">Our History:</h3>
    <h4 class="segments">Origins and Early Years (1920s-1930s) </h4>
    <p class="info">The Maple Magic Carnival began in the early 1920s as a small community fair in the heart of Central Valley,
         California. Initially, it was a modest harvest festival organized by local farmers to celebrate the end
          of the agricultural season. The event featured homemade food stands, local crafts, and live music, providing
           a space for the community to come together and share the fruits of their labor.</p>
    <h4 class="segments">Growth and Development (1940s-1960s)</h4>
    <p class="info">As Maple Magic grew, so did the carnival. Post-World War II, the festival expanded to include a wider range of
         activities. The introduction of carnival rides in the late 1940s was a significant milestone, transforming it 
         from a local fair into a more prominent event. The 1950s and 1960s saw the addition of parades, beauty pageants,
          and larger musical acts, drawing visitors from neighboring towns and cities.</p>
    <h4 class="segments">Modern Era (2000s-Present)</h4>
    <p class="info">Entering the 21st century, the Maple Magic Carnival has evolved into a major event, attracting thousands of visitors
         annually. Technology advancements have brought about more thrilling rides, state-of-the-art stage setups for
          concerts, and a significant online presence. Environmental consciousness has also become a focus, with efforts
        to make the carnival more sustainable by offering a festival recycling program</p>
        <p class="info">Today, the Maple Magic Carnival is not just a celebration of the harvest but a symbol of community resilience,
             cultural diversity, and shared joy. It stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of Central Valley, California,
              bringing together generations of families and friends in a festive atmosphere that has spanned over a century.</p>
